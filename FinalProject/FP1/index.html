      <b>Description of data:</b>
          Information on the location of lakes, the depth, the size, the region
          (NE, cornbelt, other), the secchi depth, phosphorous, chlorophyl, nitric
          oxide, and photo user days. Overall, this dataset seems to be
          investigating lake visitation and pollution in different regions, and
          how those factors interact with each other, as well as how depth and
          size interact with those factors.
    </p>

      <b>Questions:</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Where are healthy lakes located? Where unhealthy lakes located?</li>
      <li>Where are certain attributes high or low? i.e. where are the
      clearest lakes, with greater secchi depths?</li>
      <li>What are the relationships between NA, C, TP, E, and S?</li>
      <li>How does population density surrounding a lake correlate to Secchi
      depth across the lake?</li>
      <li>How does secchi depth vary across regions?</li>
      <li>How do all of the chemical variables influence Photos user days?
      </li>
      <li>Where are lakes most polluted?</li>
      <li>Using the Secchi Depth and the number of summer photos, does a
      popularity of a lake affect how clean it is?</li>
      <li>How do the average values for each parameter (Secchi depth, total
      phosphorous, chlorophyll, and nitric oxide) for each of the three
      regions (New England, Corn Belt, Other) compare?</li>
      <li>How do photo user days values compare between regions?</li>
      <li>How do photo user days values compare between lakes in the same
      region?</li>
      <li>How does population density affect any of the parameters?</li>
      <li>Do photo user days correlate to lake size?</li>
      <li>Does lake size or depth correlate with total phosphorous,
      chlorophyll, or nitric oxide parameters?</li>
      <li>Does location of the lake have an effect on the chemical/biological
      status of the lake?</li>
      <li>Do the lakes have less summer “photo user days” the more north you
        are?</li>
      <li>Does the the depth of the lake result in similar chemical composition
      of the lake?</li>
    </ul>
