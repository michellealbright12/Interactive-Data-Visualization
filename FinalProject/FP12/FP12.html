  <h3>Goals outlined in FP10 -- to-do list</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 1 (11/20-11/26) <b>[DONE]</b>: </strong>
      <ol>
        <li >Work on Choropleth map: hopefully finish up static version.</li>
        <li>Work on Scatter plot: hopefully finish up static part of animated
        one.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 2 Update (11/27-12/3): </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on Choropleth map: finish up static version and interaction.</li>
        <li >Work on Scatter plot: finish up static part of animated one and add
          animation part.</li>
        <li>Figure out what subset of original data will be most useful for 
        the animation. Also implement the other scatter plots.</li>
        <li>Work on Stacked bar chart: Implement the static stacked bar chart
          (hopefully only a couple hours worth of work for this).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Progress:</h3>
  <br>
  <h4> Map </h4>
  <p> Bo has the map plotted with all the points. The interactivity for zooming in/out on a state,
  and tooltip on hover work. The donut chart is present, but is currently static. The goals for the next week will be to address the connectivity between the hover on the lake data point and the
  donut chart, and to deal with the page performance. Since the dataset is so large, the page 
  takes a while to load. We have to figure out if its worth the wait, or if there's a better way to
  do it.</p>
  <h4>Scatter Plot</h4>
  <p> Michelle has the animated and interactive scatter plot working. Upon page load, an animation
  starts from the earliest year in the dataset, and moves up to the latest year in the dataset,
  plotting points for each year as it changes. When the mouse hovers over the year, the user can
  slide the mouse left or right to change the year manually. Things to address over the next week
  are which subset of the data is the most useful for the visualization, adding a tooltip to hover over each data point, and adding in supplementary static scatter plots. </p>
