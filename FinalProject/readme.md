Edits to the Dataset:
	- We changed a column header from Distance.Meters. to distance_meters to be
      more consistent with the rest of the column headers.

  - For the scatter plot, we filtered the lagos_epi_nutr_10541.csv file to contain
      only the entries which did not have missing values for lagoslakeid, secchi, no2
      nh4, and sampleyear. We then took the top 10 lagoslakeids with the most entries
      to plot
