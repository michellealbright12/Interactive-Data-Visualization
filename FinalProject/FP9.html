       <b> Questions for the bar chart:</b><br>
            - How does the area surrounding lakes differ in different states?<br>
            - How does the average chemical makeup differ between lakes in different states?<br>
            - What about lakes within the same state? Within the same county?<br>
            - Are lakes in some states more rural than others?<br>
            <br>
        <b>Stacked bar chart</b><br>
            - add interactivity; maybe new visualization when you click on a certain bar?<br>
                -or ability to click on one subset of the stack to compare<br>
            - think about alternative ways to categorize the data other than by state<br>
            - change attributes that we're looking at -- we used the ones that we did in
            this example so to avoid dealing with missing values. in the future we will
            make the bar chart look at a more interesting part of the data<br>
        <br>
        <b>Grouped Bar Chart</b><br>
            - hard to read because a couple of the bars are so much larger than others<br>
            - the grouping by state makes it difficult to compare across states<br>
            - the attributes in the bar chart don't connect with the questions being
            asked (will work with different data for the actual project)<br>
<br>
        <b>Questions for the scatter plot:</b><br>
            - Does a lake's size or depth affect its chemical composition?<br>
            - How does a lake's size affect its visitation?<br>
            - Do lakes in different states show different trends?<br>
            - Does the chemical composition of a lake affect the number
                of photos taken?<br>
                <br>
        <b>Scatter Plot</b><br>
            - add interactivity to change the axes as well<br>
            - maybe add some sort of hover over the circles to show more information?<br>
            - the scatterplot is good at conveying the relationships between a lot of
                different data, which is good for our data<br>

            <br>
        <b>Questions for the Histogram:</b><br>
            - Is there a trend related to the chemical composition of lakes in certain
            areas?<br>
            - How do photo user days compare across all lakes?<br>
            <br>
        <b>Histogram:</b><br>
            - Doesn't convey information efficiently<br>
            - Doesn't convey a lot of information<br>
            - Not very visually engaging<br>
            - With so many attributes in our dataset, it seems like this ignores or doesn't
            take advantage of most of the attributes
        </p>

        <p>Based on this feedback, we'd like to pursue the stacked bar chart, the
        scatter plot, and the choropleth (not included for this exercise). While the histogram
        is a cool variation of the bar chart, it leaves too much information out, and the
        scatterpot is much better at incorporating all the information needed to address
        our questions. The feedback also clearly showed us that the stacked bar chart was
        more effective and pleasing to the eye than the grouped bar chart. The scatter
        plot could have a lot of different interactive elements, so it's important
        that we monitor that so it doesn't get too confusing.</p>
