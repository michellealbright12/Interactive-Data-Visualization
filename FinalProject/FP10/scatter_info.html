  <b>Questions to answer</b><br>
  The Scatter plots are intended to answer the question: how does the chemical
  make-up of the lakes relate to lake popularity? Realtedly, how are other
  attributes of our dataset interacting with each other?
  <br>
  This visualization will compromise one main scatter plot, and two or three
  supplemental scatter plots. The main plot will use the raw data on readings of
  the chemical data from each lake. It will scatter data based on two of those
  parameters, and then animate that data over time. The size of each data point
  will be the popularity of the data, coming from the photo user day data in our
  main dataset. The supplemental scatter plots will explore data from the
  original dataset, looking at how popularity is affected by clarity,
  development in the surrounding area, and other factors yet to be determined.

  <br><br>
  <b>Interaction</b><br>
  The main scatter plot will allow the user to animate it over time. All of the
  plots will allow the user to hover over the data point and see information
  about the given lake.
  <br>
  We have a decently detailed sketch of this that is hand-drawn, and Professor
  Congdon currently has in her possesion.

  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <b>Implementation path</b><br>
  The path to finishing this includes first completing the main scatter plot.
  The supplemental plots are minor compared to this one. This will involve
  using two dataset in tandem. To accomplish this, we will have to deal with
  uneven distributed samplings of the lakes. We may end up taking lakes that
  were sampled at least a hundered times, and then all those that were sampled
  more, we will just use 100 of the samplings. Once we figure out how to
  appropriately use the data, we will move on to animating the data over time.
  Finally we will make the other scatter plots. These will follow the same hover
  action as the first, and will not use any interaction so it should be fairly
  simple.
