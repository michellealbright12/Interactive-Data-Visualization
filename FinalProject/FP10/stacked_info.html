  <b>Questions to answer</b><br>
  This visualization will answer the question: which states see the most lake
  visits, and how are those visits broken up in each state. This will be
  accomplished by making a bar for each state, and then stacking data on those
  bars. Each stack of the data will be a "bucket" within the range of the total
  photo user days (PUD) for our dataset. So for example, if in Vermont the range
  of PUDs for the
  lakes is 10-500, we would break up the stacks on the bar from 10-100, 100-200,
  etc... and then make the size of each bar connected to the total count for
  each bucket on the range. The size of the bar would then be equal to the total
  number of PUDs in that state


  <br><br>
  <b>Interaction</b><br>
  Most states will see that they get many visits in the low 10s-20s over the
  ten years of photo data that we have (our access to the data is already
  in aggregate form unfortunately). But, it will be clear that some states have
  lakes that are visited hundred if not thousands of times over 10 years, and
  hopefully this visualization will provide a clear cut way to see how those
  visitations are distributed across the states, and then how they're distributed
  within each state. The interaction here will provide the user insight into
  each state. As the user hovers of a certain stack on a bar, a map of that
  state will appear on the side of the bar chart. This map will plot each lake
  on it, and the lakes that fall into the "hovered" stack of the bar will be
  highlighted against the rest. The radius of each data point will be scaled
  based on the total PUD of that lake.

  We have a decently detailed sketch of this that is hand-drawn, and Professor
  Congdon currently has in her possesion.

      <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mstanaland/6100713">This</a> visualization
      gives a good idea of how we can implement a stacked bar chart, and then
      add a hover tooltip. In our case, however, the tooltip will not follow the
      mouse; it will be on the side.

    <li>
      <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5562380">This</a> visualization
      shows how we can plot a single state. This will be used for the hover
      info.

  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <b>Implementation path</b><br>
  As with all of our visualizations, we will need to clean the data and reduce
  it down to what we need for this specific project first.
  Then, we need to get the bar chart up and running. This might involve some
  data aggregation, as well as some thought as to how to deal with missing data,
  if there is any. That said, it should be pretty straight forward. Once we
  figure out the data aggregation techniques required, the bar chart itself
  shouldn't take too long. It will then fall on us to create the hover state
  SVG visualization, which might take a while to figure out.
