  <b>Questions to answer</b><br>
  This Choropleth map will answer the question: how does the surrounding area
  and chemical make up of a lake affect its popularity and how do those
  variables change across regions? The map will take on a couple different froms
  depending on how the user is viewing the map. When the map is completely
  zoomed out, the user will see a point for each lake in the dataset, with the
  radius for that point uniform across all the lakes. The user can hover over a
  state, and on the side of the visualization there will be a donut chart that
  shows the average chemical make-up of the lakes in that state. As the user
  hovers over states, the state itself will highlight, and when the user clicks
  on a state, it will zoom in on that state. This activates the second way of
  viewing the map. When a state is zoomed in on, the radius of the circles
  adjusts so that it now correspond to the photo user days (PUD) of the given
  lake. Now when a lake is hovered over, the donut chart will show the chemical
  make-up of that specific lake, and if there is missing data it will note that
  there isn't enough data on that lake to display. The color of each point will
  correspond to a selected parameter, displaying on a color-scale the value of
  that parameter. These parameter options will be the parameters in the dataset
  that describe the surrounding area around each lake.

  <b>Interaction</b><br>
  As described above, there are three possible interactions with this
  visualization: hovering, zooming, and changing a parameter. Because the
  interactions are important to how the visualization is viewed and answers
  questions about the dataset, they
  are described above. The most important one is probably zooming. This will
  allow the user more ability to explore the data in depth. It will take some
  textual description to make sure that it is clear how this works, but
  hopefully we can make it intuitive.
  <br>
  We have a decently detailed sketch of this that is hand-drawn, and Professor
  Congdon currently has in her possesion.

  For reference:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590">This</a> shows a good
      example of zooming in on a state. We will use this with a subset of the
      US data, using only the states that we need.

      <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193">This</a> visualization is
      a good example of a donut chart.

  </ul>

  <b>Implementation path</b><br>
  The path to implementing this requires first implementing the static map.
  We need GEOJson data on the states in question, then we need to get the
  projection right so that only those states are visible. After that we need to
  read in the csv file and add the data to the map.
  Next, we will need to implement the zooming. This will not allow the user to
  brush around the map, so the first example in the reference section is good.
  As the user zooms, the bubbles for each lake will need to change so that has
  to be implemented in tandem with the zooming. Finally we need to add the donut
  chart on the side. We expect that this will take some time, given that it is
  doing a different thing based on the user's position in the map. That will be
  our reach goal, and if we can't get that done that's ok.
