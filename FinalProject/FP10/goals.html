  <b>Our visualizations</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="stacked_info.html">Stacked bar chart</a> of photo user days
      grouped by state and sorted by most photos total. Photos user days are
      proved to be correlated to visitations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="map_info.html">Choropleth map</a> of all lakes in the dataset.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="scatter_info.html">Scatter plots</a> of various elements of our
      dataset.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>

  <b>Potential roadblocks</b><br>
  Where we stand now, we don't see too many roadblocks in our path. We
  anticipate that the interaction on the Choropleth map, and the animation on
  the scatter plot will take some time, but it isn't anything that we don't
  think we can handle. The hover info for the map and the bar chart will be a
  stretch goal for the moment, but we do hope that we can get those done in time
  for the submission of our project.
  <br>
  The data aggreagation and cleaning that we need to do could pose some
  difficulties, but that should be fairly repeatable for all three
  visualizations.
  <br>
  There are no foreseeable unknowns at this point.

  <b>Week-by-week goals</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 1 (11/20-11/26): </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on Choropleth map: hopefully finish up static version.</li>
        <li>Work on Scatter plot: hopefully finish up static part of animated
        one.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 2 (11/27-12/3): </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on Choropleth map: finish up static version and interaction.</li>
        <li>Work on Scatter plot: finish up static part of animated one and add
          animation part. Also implement the other scatter plots.</li>
        <li>Work on Stacked bar chart: Implement the static stacked bar chart
          (hopefully only a couple hours worth of work for this).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 3 (12/4-12/10): </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on Choropleth map: finish up interaction with zooming and hover
          over donut chart.</li>
        <li>Work on Scatter plot: finish up animation part. Make sure
          interaction for the other scatter plots if cleaned up.</li>
        <li>Work on Stacked bar chart: Make sure static version is good, add
          hover information with map of hovered state. This might span into
          Week 4, especially the work on the highlighted data points part.</li>
        <li>Begin working on final presentation.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 4 (12/11-12/15): </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on Choropleth map: clean up any remaining issues.</li>
        <li>Work on Scatter plot: clean up any remaining issues.</li>
        <li>Work on Stacked bar chart: complete interactive part, make sure that
          hover info is what we want. Clean up remaining issues.</li>
        <li>Finalize final presentation.</li>
        <strong>Project Due 12/15</strong>
      </ol>
    </li>
