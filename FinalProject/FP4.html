    <b>Background Info:</b>
    <br>
   	This dataset contains information about lakes in the Eastern half of
   	the United States. This includes attributes like the lake's ID, latitude,
   	longitude, county and state, and information about the lake's quality
   	such as the chemical makeup of the lake, its depth & area, and the Secchi
   	depth. The Secchi depth is correlated to how eutrophic a lake is, which
   	is a measure of the lake's quality. Each lake also has information on the "photo user days", which is the number of days a picture was uploaded
   	online of that lake, which is correlated to the number of visitors to that
   	lake. The goal of the dataset is to see if there is a correlation
   	between the health of a lake & the number of photo user days, and how
   	that changes among different regions in the US.

    <b>Project Overview:</b>
    <br>
    The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization of
    lakes in the US to show how attributes of a lake affect the number
    of visitors to that lake. We have predicted that healthier lakes will have
    more visitors, so we would expect to see a correlation between Secchi
    depth/chemical readings and the number of photo user days. We would also
    expect this to differ between New England and the Cornbelt, as lakes in
    the Cornbelt region are generally more eutrophic. The choropleth visualization
    will allow the user to explore the relationships between location,
    chemical makeup of the lake, and the number of visitors. The scatter
    plot will explore how photo user days of lakes have changed over time
    in response to changes in chemicals, nearby populations, and industrialization.

    <b>Data Manipulations:</b>
    <br>
    Because the dataset is so large, and many entries have missing data.
    This could cause issues when reading in the data, and would also
    significantly increase the lag of the website. To combat this, we
    will write several python scripts to filter out entries with missing
    data that is needed for each visualization. This will result in 3-4
    smaller subsets of the original data, which is what our code will
    be working from.
    <br><br>
    Also, because the number of datapoints is so large, we will often
    only use a random subset of the data. This will avoid the problem
    of there being so many datapoints that they cannot be distinguished.
    For example, our animated scatterplot will contain the 10 lakes with
    the most available datapoints, as per the suggestion of our collaborator.
